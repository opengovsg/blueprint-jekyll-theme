The dispute between The Singapore Manual & Mercantile Workers’ Union and China Airlines Limited related to the salary ranges for bargainable employees in the proposed collective agreement between the two parties. The Union sought an increase in the maximum of the salary ranges, while the Company proposed to raise only the minimum of each salary range. Following the hearing on 18 July 2014, the Court has been adjourned to a date to be fixed. This is to allow the parties time to review their proposals based on the Court’s guidance, and, where feasible, resume their negotiations to reach an amicable settlement.
