The Singapore Industrial & Services Employees Union sought an order from the Court that First Defense Services Pte Ltd be directed to pay its employees an annual salary increment of 5% with effect from 1 Jul 2011, or alternatively a one-off lump sum equal to 1 month's salary. The company claimed that it was not in a financial position to given an increment. The Court decided that the company should pay a built-in increment of $50 on the monthly basic salary of employees earning up to and including $2,000 per month and a built-in increment of 2.5% of the monthly basic salary for employees earning above $2,000 per month.
