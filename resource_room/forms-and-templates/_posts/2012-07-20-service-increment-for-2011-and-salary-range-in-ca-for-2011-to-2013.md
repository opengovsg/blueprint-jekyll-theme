The dispute between the Singapore Refining Company Employees' Union and the Singapore Refining Company Pte Ltd related to the quantum of service increment to be granted to employees in 2011 and the salary range to be provided in the new Collective Agreement for the period 2011 to 2013. The Union proposed an increment of 5.5% + $38 built-in quantum, while the Company offered an increment of 5% +$15. Further, the Union proposed an increase in the bargainable salary range provided in the last CA by 5% with effect from 1 Jan 2011 while the Company proposed an increase of 3%. The Court found in favour of the Company. In response to the Court’s concern with the high proportion of variable pay in bargainable employees’ total pay, the Company agreed to increase the fixed components of total pay effective from 2013.
