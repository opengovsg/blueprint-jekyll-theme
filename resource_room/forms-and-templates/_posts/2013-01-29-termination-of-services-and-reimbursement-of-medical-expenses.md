The Singapore Catering Services, Staffs & Workers Trade Union appealed against the Refereeâ€™s decision on the dispute relating to termination of service and reimbursement of medical expenses of an ex-employee of Hollandse Club. The Court found that the termination of service was proper and that the Club had already reimbursed medical expenses in excess of the limit provided in the Collective Agreement. The appeal was thus dismissed.
